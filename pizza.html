    <h3>Brick-Oven Pizza (Brooklyn Style)<h3>
        <p><em>This simple brick-oven pizza recipe has been made famous by several well-known, Brooklyn wood-fire pizzerias. Best accompanied by ice-cold, pilsner-style lager beer.</em></P>
            <h1><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Pizza dough</li>
                <li>6 oz Mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1.5 tsp Dried oregano</li>
                <li>1.25 tsp Black pepper</li>
                <li>1.5 cups Canned crushed tomatoes - no salt</li>
                <li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>6 torn basil leaves</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Steps:</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour</li>
                    <li>Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.</li>
                    <li>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.</li>
                    <li>With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the peel easily. Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work surface. Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Repeat steps and make more pizzas!</em></strong></li>
                </ol>
